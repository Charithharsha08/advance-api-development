# Advance API Development  

This repository explores advanced concepts in **API development** with several modules. It demonstrates working with **AJAX requests**, **connection pooling** (manual and Tomcat-based), and handling **JSON** data using `JSONObject`, `JSONReader`, and related classes.  

---

## üöÄ Key Topics Covered  

1. **AJAX Requests:**  
   - Demonstrates how to send and handle asynchronous requests to the server.  
   - Shows how to update web content dynamically without refreshing the page.  

2. **Connection Pooling:**  
   - **Manual Implementation:** Learn how to create a custom connection pool for database interactions.  
   - **Using Tomcat Connection Pooling:** Utilize the built-in connection pool in Tomcat for efficient resource management.  

3. **JSON Handling:**  
   - Create, parse, and process JSON objects using `JSONObject`.  
   - Use `JSONReader` to handle incoming JSON requests.  
   - Demonstrates how to structure API responses in JSON format.  

4. **API Modules:**  
   - Multiple modules showcasing various API development techniques and best practices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies  

- **Java**  
- **AJAX**  
- **JSON (JSONObject, JSONReader)**  
- **Apache Tomcat**
